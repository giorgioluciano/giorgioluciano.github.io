Here are some of the most interesting R packages I’ve discovered among the 2025 releases. These are especially useful for demographic statistics, teaching, and time series correlation analysis.

---

### **DemographicTable: Create Demographic Table**

*tags*: #statistics #table  
[cran package link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DemographicTable)

*description from the author/vignette*  

> To create demographic tables with simple summary statistics, with optional comparison(s) over one or more groups.
>
> *I like this package because I’ve always been interested in demographic statistics and it offers a straightforward way to create descriptive tables, easily integrated with workflows using `flextable` and `officer`.*

### **testcorr: Testing Zero Correlation**

*tags*: #statistics #correlation #timeseries  
[cran package link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testcorr)

*description from the author/vignette*  

> Computes the test statistics for examining the significance of autocorrelation in univariate time series, cross-correlation in bivariate time series, Pearson correlations in multivariate series, and test statistics for the i.i.d. property of univariate series.
>
> *I feature this one because students often ask me about correlation testing, and standard tests are not always well-known or directly available: this package covers autocorrelation, cross-correlation, and more for time series data, with robust methods.*

### **jmv: The 'jamovi' Analyses**

*tags*: #statistics #suite #teaching  
[cran package link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=jmv)

*description from the author/vignette*  

> A suite of common statistical methods such as descriptives, t-tests, ANOVAs, regression, correlation matrices, proportion tests, contingency tables, and factor analysis. This package is also useable from the 'jamovi' statistical spreadsheet (see [jamovi.org](https://www.jamovi.org) for more information).
>
> *Jamovi is a great all-in-one suite for statistical analysis, perfect even for beginners. My students find it intuitive and well documented. You can use it seamlessly from R or via its modern, open-source GUI. Super versatile!*
