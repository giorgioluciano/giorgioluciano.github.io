Here are some of the most interesting R packages I’ve discovered among the 2025 releases. These are especially useful for demographic statistics, teaching, and time series correlation analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **DemographicTable: Create Demographic Table**

*tags*: #statistics #table\
[cran package link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DemographicTable)

*description from the author/vignette*

> To create demographic tables with simple summary statistics, with optional comparison(s) over one or more groups.
