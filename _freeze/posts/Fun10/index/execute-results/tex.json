To better understand the implications of pizza size on the amount of pizza consumed, we establish a new standard unit called the *standard pizza radius*, denoted by the letter $a$, which measures 6 inches. This article examines how the area of a pizza changes with size and demonstrates that one extra-large pizza can provide more pizza than two standard-sized pizzas.\n\n# The Area of a Standard Pizza\n\nThe area of a pizza, approximated as a circle, with a radius of one standard pizza radius ($a$) is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{standard}} = \\pi a^2\n$$\n\n# The Area of an Extra-Large Pizza\n\nFor an extra-large pizza with a radius $r = 1.5a$, the area can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{extra-large}} = \\pi (1.5a)^2 = \\pi \\cdot 1.5^2 \\cdot a^2 = \\pi \\cdot 2.25 \\cdot a^2\n$$\n\n# Comparison: Two Standard Pizzas vs. One Extra-Large Pizza\n\nThe combined area of two standard pizzas with radius $a$ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{two standard}} = 2 \\cdot \\pi a^2\n$$\n\nComparing this to the area of one extra-large pizza:\n\n$$\n\\pi \\cdot 2.25 \\cdot a^2 > 2 \\cdot \\pi a^2\n$$\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n$$\n2.25 \\pi a^2 > 2 \\pi a^2\n$$\n\nThus, the area of one extra-large pizza is greater than the combined area of two standard pizzas.\n\n# Minimum Radius for Extra-Large Pizza to Always Be Larger\n\nTo determine the minimum radius $r = n \\cdot a$ for the extra-large pizza to always have a greater area than two standard pizzas, we start with the inequality:\n\n$$\n\\pi (n \\cdot a)^2 > 2 \\cdot \\pi a^2\n$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\nn^2 \\cdot \\pi a^2 > 2 \\cdot \\pi a^2\n$$\n\n$$\nn^2 > 2\n$$\n\n$$\nn > \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\n$$\nn > 1.4142\n$$\n\nTherefore, the radius of the extra-large pizza must be at least $\\sqrt{2}$ times the radius of a standard pizza to ensure its area is always greater than that of two standard pizzas.\n\n# A Practical Example: Pizza Napoletana\n\nIn Italy, according to the *Disciplinare verace pizza napoletana* (guidelines for authentic Neapolitan pizza), the radius of a pizza ranges from 22 to 35 cm. Let's compare the area of two pizzas with a 22 cm radius to one pizza with a 33 cm radius.\n\n-   **Two pizzas with 22 cm radius:**\n\n$$\n2 \\cdot \\pi \\cdot 22^2 = 2 \\cdot \\pi \\cdot 484 = 2 \\cdot 1520.56 = 3039.52 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n$$\n\n-   **One pizza with 33 cm radius:**\n\n$$\n\\pi \\cdot 33^2 = \\pi \\cdot 1089 = 3419.46 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n$$\n\nThis calculation confirms that one pizza with a 33 cm radius has a greater area than two pizzas with a 22 cm radius. Therefore, it is mathematically established that consuming one extra-large pizza results in more pizza than consuming two smaller ones.\n",
