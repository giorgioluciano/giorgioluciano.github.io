Roulette, a classic casino game, is known for its unpredictability, making it an interesting subject for probability exploration.\n\n## ***Simulating Roulette Spins***\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Function to simulate roulette spins\nsimulate_roulette_spins <- function(n) {\n  set.seed(42)  # Set seed for reproducibility\n  numbers <- sample(0:36, n, replace = TRUE)\n  return(numbers)\n}\n\n# Simulate roulette spins for different scenarios\nspins_1000 <- simulate_roulette_spins(1000)\nspins_10000 <- simulate_roulette_spins(10000)\nspins_100000 <- simulate_roulette_spins(100000)\nspins_1_year <- simulate_roulette_spins(365 * 24 * 40)  # One year of spins\n```\n:::\n\n\n## ***Analyzing Frequency of Number 0***\n\nMoving on, let's analyze the frequency of the number 0 in each simulation. We'll count the occurrences to gain insights into its distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Function to count occurrences of number 0\ncount_zero_occurrences <- function(spins) {\n  return(sum(spins == 0))\n}\n\n# Count occurrences for different scenarios\nzero_count_1000 <- count_zero_occurrences(spins_1000)\nzero_count_10000 <- count_zero_occurrences(spins_10000)\nzero_count_100000 <- count_zero_occurrences(spins_100000)\nzero_count_1_year <- count_zero_occurrences(spins_1_year)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## **Visualizing the Results**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a bar plot for zero occurrences\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndata <- data.frame(Scenario = c(\"1000 spins\", \"10000 spins\", \"100000 spins\", \"1 year\"),\n                   Zero_Count = c(zero_count_1000, zero_count_10000, zero_count_100000, zero_count_1_year))\n\nplot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Scenario, y = Zero_Count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Number 0 in Roulette Spins\",\n       x = \"Simulation Scenario\",\n       y = \"Number of 0 occurrences\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nprint(plot)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Results and Insights\n\nAfter simulating roulette spins and analyzing the frequency of the number 0, we'll gain valuable insights into the likelihood of encountering this specific outcome over different scenarios.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nExploring the probability of specific outcomes in casino games through simulation provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of chance. Whether you're interested in statistics, data science, or simply curious, these simulations offer an engaging way to understand the dynamics of games of chance.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different parameters, such as the number of spins or the distribution of numbers on the roulette wheel, and observe how the results change. Happy exploring!\n\nNote: a fast search with bing about how many time does a roulette spin in a vegas casino : Explore\n\n[The average roulette wheel spins around **40-50 times per hour** when playing roulette at a casino in Las Vegas^1^](https://www.casinoonline.tf/how-many-times-does-a-roulette-wheel-spin-in-an-hour/). [However, this can vary depending on the type of wheel, the number of players at the table, and how quickly bets are placed^1^](https://www.casinoonline.tf/how-many-times-does-a-roulette-wheel-spin-in-an-hour/).
